This will hopefully be a nice, catchall place for nearly damn everything Friday Night Funkin' related for fans, modders, freaks, and addicts.

> I intend for this to be a bit community run type beat. I'll slowly find things and add it to this list, but I am not the biggest Friday Night Funkin' maniac, and not by a damn longshot!
> The inspiration behind this list thingie is those Github AWESOME lists that have a billion damn resources. I'm no FNF maniac, but I think it would be nice if everything was in one place!!!
> I will host this on the FunkinCrew github page, and upload it to the FNF website, but otherwise, I will say if there's dedicated people around, I'm willing to let some trusted individuals who are much more in touch than me to keep things around here nice and pleasant and a nice resource that doesn't get too outdated!
